** A-BUGS: 
- Density profiles for Grids don't work correctly with MPI ! Only small changes to toFile(...) are probably needed ...
- UpdateIncidentSimplices seem to have a very rarely occuring bug, so it is desactivated for now: all the incidences are recomputed everytime.

** B-TODO NOW:
- Implement a way to gather potential without having to store a full grid of size the projection mesh on each process !

** C-TODO SOONER:
- factorize vertices of AMR grid when dumping if vertices have been computed

** D-TODO :
- Add a poincare invariant check over all simplices.
- the ghost layer can grow too much if no repartitionning/unrefinement occur, add an option for resetting it when appropriate.
- symmetries do not work with MPI! but that's more complicated to deal with ...
- Check that projection is robust WRT twice degenerate simplices (i.e. all 4 vertices are aligned)
- Allow the ROOT level of AMR grid to change -> it should increase with time and end up removing the need for initial refinement !
- Implement isotropic refinement (i.e. predefined segment spliting order, see in biblio ...)
- Remove the need for a simplex tree if unrefinement is desactivated

** E-TODO LATER:
- Point in simplex tests can probably be made faster by first testing barycentric coordinates and segmentFace intersection. Could also cache orientations of each vertex ...
- Allow multiple fields in localAMR
- In localAMRGridProjector, allow projecting several fields at the same time (e.g. add a nfields in a the projection functors)

** F-TODO OR NOT TODO :
- make FFTWConvolver compatible with margins ? (e.g. for the force interpolation)
- Optimize the AMR grid generation : we should be able to update the grid from the previous time step instead of computing it from scratch every time ...
